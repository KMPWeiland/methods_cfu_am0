# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?

*I'm proud figuring out why there was a persistant error message in code that was mostly correct. I realized I didn't add the required `end` to the if statements within a method, even though I did have the `end` closing the method. It was really satisfying when I added that necessary `end` and everything worked!*

- What is the power of using methods in our applications?

*Their resuability!!!!*
